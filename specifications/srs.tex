\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose} ~~~
The purpose of the document is to collect and analyze all assorted ideas that
have come up to define the system, its requirements with respect to consumers.
Also, we shall predict and sort out how we hope this product will be used in
order to gain a better understanding of the project, outline concepts that may
be developed later, and document ideas that are being considered, but may be
discarded as the product develops.

In short, the purpose of this SRS document is to provide a detailed overview
of our software product, its parameters and goals. This document describes the
project's target audience and its user interface, hardware and software
requirements. It defines how our client, team and audience see the product
and its functionalities. Nonetheless, it helps any designer and developer to
assist in software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) processes.

% $<$Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this
% document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the
% product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only
% part of the system or a single subsystem.$>$

\section{Document Conventions} ~~~
% $<$Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when
% writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance.
% For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are assumed
% to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement
% is to have its own priority.$>$

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions} ~~~
This SRS is addressed to all stakeholders of the software: the governmental
agency which need to monitor the air quality, the air cleaner providers which
want to observe the impact of the cleaners on air quality and private individuals
who participate in air quality data generation by installing fixed sensors at
their homes. It is also addressed to developers who will develop the application
and administrators responsible for software maintenance. The project manager
can also follow the progress of the software specifications by reading this
document.

End users must focus their reading on \textit{System Features} while developpers
and administrators should also pay attention to \textit{External Interface
Requirements} and \textit{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}.

% $<$Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for,
% such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and
% documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is
% organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the
% overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to
% each reader type.$>$

\section{Project Scope} ~~~
The \textit{AirWatcher} application is a console-based application that helps
its users monitor the air quality as well as the quality of the data provided by
the sensors used for data collection. This application is designed to improve
air quality analysis by providing efficient algorithms for calculating indicators
as well as checking the data reliability.

More specificaly, the application provide, on demand metrics for a circular area
specified by the user. Besides, the AirWatcher will continously analyse data in
order to identify malfunctioning sensors as well as wether the defect is willingly
made or naturally caused.

Moreover, the application will also be responsible for managing the Governments's
points system, which attributes a point to a private sensor owner each time their
sensors's data are requested in a query for analysis. On the other hand, if the
application identifies that the user is willingly distorting their sensors data,
AirWatcher will mark the user as non-applicable for being awarded points.

By doig so, the application will allow the government agency to really monitor
the air quality in order to taking the right measures for maintaining or
improving air quality and as a consequence, the quality of life.

% $<$Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose,
% including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to
% corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document
% is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.$>$

\section{References} ~~~
% $<$List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may
% include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements
% specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide
% enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference,
% including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.$>$

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective} ~~~
The application is part of a more global project. The project consists of a
client server application. The end users, which are sensors, send their data to
the server where AirWatcher is running. The data collection is out of scope of
AirWatcher and is supposed to be fully operational. AirWatcher is a response to
a governmental need. Indeed government agencies want to be able to monitor the air
quality of specific areas so they could be able to take decisions (for example,
install air cleaners in pollued zones) to improve the quality of life.

The data collection application and AirWatcher do not have to interface together.
The only constraint is that the data collection, which will imply dataset
updates, and AirWatcher should not run at the same moment.

% $<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.
% For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product
% family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained
% product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the
% requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and
% identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major
% components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external
% interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functions} ~~~
The AirWatcher application will allow analysis of the data generated by a sensor
to make sure that it is functioning correctly and otherwise identify and maintain
malfunctioning sensors. The application will aggregate the collected information
to produce statistics such as the calculation of the mean of the quality of air
in a specific area specified by the user. The mean of the quality of air can be
calculated for a given moment as well as for a specified period of time. The
application will also enable selecting one sensor and then scoring and ranking
all other sensors in terms of similarity to the selected sensor. The similarity
will be based on the data generated by the sensors during a specified period of
time. The purpose of this functionality is to identify areas with similar air
quality. The Application must produce the value of air quality at a precise
geographical position in the territory at a given moment. The agency and the
providers could use AirWatcher to observe the impact of the cleaners on air
quality, for example, the radius of the cleaned zone, the level of improvement
in air quality, etc... Finally, the application will provide a console based
user interface to its different users.

% $<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user
% perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary
% (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them
% understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of
% related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram
% or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics} ~~~
There are four types of users that interact with the system: the government
agency, the providers of "air cleaners", the private individuals who participate
in air quality data generation by installing fixed sensors at their homes and
administrators. Each of these four types of users has different use of the
system so each of them has their own requirements.

The government agency is able to analyse the data generated by a sensor to
make sure that it is functioning correctly. Then it will be able to identify
and maintain malfunctioning sensors. There is only one government agency but we
can suppose it will use the software relatively frequently. This user can use
all the functionalities associated with statistics. This is the most important
user of our application.

The providers use AirWatcher to observe the impact of the cleaners on air
quality, for example, the radius of the cleaned zone, the level of improvement
in air quality, etc... There is less than 100 such kind of users. This user
can also use all the functionalities associated with statistics with an
relatively high frequency.

The private individuals participate in air quality data generation by installing
fixed sensors at their homes. These types of users are very numerous but most of
them does not use the software frequently. This user also have access to all the
the functionalities associated with statistics.

Each user can manage its account. They all have a username and password.

\framebox{here, tell about actor attributes}

% 1) Les utilisateurs doivent se connecter -> creer un compte etc (on nous demande pas de tout développer)
% 2) Les utilisateurs peuvent changer ses données, mdp etc
% 3) A chaque fois qu'on lance l'app on va relancer les analyses -> y compris trouver ceux qui sont faux
% 4) Ils doivent pouvoir faire des tests avec leurs données assez facilement

% $<$Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.
% User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product
% functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational
% level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.
% Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the
% most important user classes for this product from those who are less important
% to satisfy.$>$

\section{Operating Environment} ~~~
The AirWatcher application operates in any modern operating system without any
particular restrictions. It uses a client-server architecture. The software runs
on the server while end users send their data. The server needs a \textit{10.2.0+
g++} version. It may work with an older version but it has not been tested.

% $<$Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the
% hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software
% components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.$>$

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints} ~~~
The project must be developed in \textit{C++}. The application must not modify
the data files. The algorithms used to analyse the data must be efficient.
Therefore, the performance of the algorithms must be measurable. The metric of
performance will be the duration of execution of an algorithm, measured in
milliseconds.

The application should be developed following the layered architecture pattern.
The different layers are: the user interface layer, the authentication layer
and the statistic functionalities layer.

% $<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the
% developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware
% limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other
% applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel
% operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security
% considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the
% customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered
% software).$>$

\section{User Documentation} ~~~
The application provides a user manual which consists of a basic description of
the user interface. This user manual follows the \textit{Linux man-pages} format.

% $<$List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help,
% and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any
% known user documentation delivery formats or standards.$>$

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies} ~~~
We assume that the data the application needs (on sensors, providers, users,
cleaners, etc...) is present and precisely located on the server. We alse assume
that those files are correct plain text documents in csv format. The software is
not responsible for the data collection. We therefore suppose that the data is
collected beforehand. We also take for granted that the data will not be
modified while the software is running.

The software does not rely on any dependency.

% $<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the
% requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial
% components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating
% environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions
% are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the
% project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to
% reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for
% example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$

\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces} ~~~
There is one command line user interface. Once the program is running, the user
is prompted to inform his username and password. If the credentials are recognized
by the application the access is granted and the menu appears. If not, the
credentials are asked again.

The menu of government agency and air cleaner provider consists of 8 options:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item get statistics at a specific time
	\item get statistics in a time interval
	\item rank sensors in function of similarity
	\item get the value of air at a specified position
	\item get cleaners impact on the air quality
	\item modify my account
	\item logout
	\item shutdown
\end{enumerate}

The menu of private individuals consists of 9 options:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item get statistics at a specific time
	\item get statistics in a time interval
	\item rank sensor in function of similarity
	\item get the value of air at a specified position
	\item get cleaners impact on the air quality
	\item modify my account
	\item Get my personnal score
	\item logout
	\item shutdown
\end{enumerate}

\section{Safety Requirements} ~~~
There is the possibility that a private individual may act maliciously and corrupt their sensor in order
to provide false data. Therefore, the AirWatcher application will allow the government agency to
analyze the data provided by a private individual’s sensor and classify its behavior as reliable or
unreliable. If a private individual is detected to provide unreliable data, their entire data will be
marked as false and will be excluded from all further queries on the application. This will prevent the
user from gaining any further points.
